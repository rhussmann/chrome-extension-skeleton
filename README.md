# chrome-extension-skeleton
## Overview
I don't make Chrome extensions often (or ever, really). For a recent project I
wanted to make a Chrome extension and figured Angular would be a great fit, but
I couldn't find any great examples. This repo is an example.

## Prerequisites
You'll need to have node.js, npm and bower installed. I won't go into installing
node.js and npm, but if you haven't installed bower you can install it by
running `npm install -g bower`.

## Getting Started
1. Install bower dependencies with `bower install`
